Once you talk with him ! Let's drink 🧉

You can ask him what he can do by welcoming him. You can tell him what you have in your fridge or what you have in order to get a cocktail. You can also ask him to give you the nutritional incomes of each ingredient in you cocktail, the way to know it is by using the quick reply.
Furthermore, you can ask him a random cocktail in various ways, as "Give me a good cocktail !" or "Tell me a drink". You will be able to know the nutritional incomes with a quick reply again and you can also with quick reply ask for another one. You can also ask him another one by saying sentences like "Once again" or "Another one".

Last advise, talk to him in English ! 🇬🇧

Enjoy ! 😊
